# About

I am a software engineer at [wave](sendwave.com).  I love [devops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) and automated software testing, and sometimes even automated testing of devops software.  I'm also interested in how people learn computer science, and tools that help build conceptual understanding as well as the ability to make things.

I graduated from MIT in 2013 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math.  While there I helped organize [Splash](http://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash), and I now volunteer for [Learning Unlimited](http://learningu.org) to help spread Splash beyond MIT.

I love folk music and dance.  I [contra dance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_dance), waltz, and dabble in other dance styles.  I also play [Swedish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIViyqKLE4w) and contra dance music on fiddle, accordion, and [nyckelharpa](http://www.nyckelharpa.org/about/what-is-a-nyckelharpa/), and I love to sing.
