# About

I am a software engineer for [CloudFoundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.com/).

I graduated from MIT in 2013 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math.  While there I helped organize [Splash](http://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash), and I now volunteer for [Learning Unlimited](http://learningu.org) to help spread Splash beyond MIT.

I love folk music and dance.  I [contra dance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_dance), waltz, and dabble in other dance styles.  I also play [Swedish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIViyqKLE4w) and contra dance music on fiddle, accordion, and [nyckelharpa](http://www.nyckelharpa.org/about/what-is-a-nyckelharpa/), and I love to sing.
