title: Teaching Dance Roles
---

What if, when teaching new social dancers to dance, instead of dividing by gender or choice, we just taught everyone to follow first?

I think learning to follow is easier than learning to lead.  That's not a value judgment, but an observation.  As a beginning follow dancing with an experienced lead, you get good feedback on what you should be doing.  You'll know it if you're tripping over the lead's feet, or if the lead is pulling you somewhere besides where you are.  Importantly, a follow will typically be able to feel not only that they're doing something wrong, but in which direction they should adjust.  Leads also get some feedback from how comfortable the movements seem, but that feedback is less directed than what follows usually get from leads.

Empirically, I find beginning follows more fun to dance with than beginning leads.  I have more control as a lead over how we share weight, how fast we turn, and whether we're on the music than when following.  When dancing with beginning waltz leads, I often feel conflicted over whether to backlead, which will help my partner learn what to do with their feet and how to get around but mislead them about how to show a follow what to do, or not, which will help them learn how to take responsibility for where the follow is, but leave them clueless about what to do with their feet and how to get around.

Anecdotally, I was following for years before learning to lead, and I learned lots of different couples dances (rotary waltz, cross step waltz, redowa, polka, hambo, schottis, blues) with basically no formal training, not even the one-hour lesson before the dance.  When started to I learn to lead dances, I picked it up pretty quickly and got compliments on my leading when I hadn't been doing it for very long.

There are obviously some problems with this plan.  Currently role balancing is rarely a problem, but teaching everyone to follow first might make it a chronic issue.  To make this work, you'd need to have a strong norm of learning to lead as soon as you feel confident enough to.  Even so occasional dancers, underconfident dancers, and anyone who just has a harder time learning to dance might never learn the other role.  

Following first is probably a gentler path into the dance world than leading first, but I'm not sure how much of an effect this has.  I see enough excellent dancers in both roles that I'm pretty sure that it doesn't take an unreasonable amount of time to get started as a lead.  I doubt the system of teaching everyone the same role first would work well for dance communities, but it's a possible alternative, and it would plausibly be better for individuals.
