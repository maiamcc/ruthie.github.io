title: Happiness and the World's Imperfections

## Origins

There's a type of thought experiment typified here:

> On the planet of Hypothetica, there are two groups of people identical except for their hair color: Blues and Greens. They have equal capabilities in every respect, but the Blue majority believe Greens are inferior, Greens are discriminated against, and as a result Greens are poorer, less happy, and live shorter lives.

> Is creating an additional Blue person in Hypothetica better than creating a Green person, since the Blue person will be happier and live longer?

> A baby is born in Hypothetica with orange hair. The doctors say to the parents, "he has a rare condition and will die unless he is treated. A side effect of the treatment is that his hair will change colors, but you can choose whether he ends up with blue or green hair." Is it better to choose that the baby end up with blue hair? Is choosing to give the baby blue hair as morally good as any other action that similarly increases his lifespan by a few years and increases his happiness?

> How good is it to provide hair dye to one Green, thereby enabling him to become Blue?

(These questions are from Stanford Effective Altruism discussion questions, which I found [here](http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/hl/how_we_run_discussions_at_stanford_ea/))

These questions have analogues that hit closer to home.  If you could choose the sexuality of your child, what would you choose?  They also have analogues that people actually have to make decisions about.  Do you give a deaf child a chochlear implant, allowing them to hear, but potentially removing them from a community and source of identity?  Should a bisexual person remain closeted and choose an opposite-gender partner in order to gain straight privilege?  As a parent, do you encourage or discourage a child's non-standard gender expression?

Note: unlike on Hypothetica, we can't say by fiat what likely outcomes will be, and for these examples I genuinely don't know.  However, it seems extremely likely that these decisions *do* affect life outcomes, and an intellectually honest researcher might find the decision that likely causes the best outcomes is not the one that they prefer or the one that is socially sanctioned.  Even if these particular cases the decisions are easy, that's extremely unlikely always to be the case.

I find this kind of decision extremely confusing.  Naively, I would say that I want to maximize happiness, so to be consistent with my moral stance, I would have to give out blue hair dye to greens, and do what I can to produce myself privileged children children.

But I also don't want to live in a world of only white people.  If I could suddenly make all the black people in the US white, I would potentially improve a lot of their lives by objective measures, but simultaneously strip many of those same lives of a major source of meaning.  Would those people choose that outcome?  Even if they wouldn't, would their lives be better afterwards?

## Happiness in my life

There are multiple senses of the word "happiness."

One is moment-to-moment happiness.  I'm going to call this enjoyment.  There are a lot of things that I get enjoyment out of.  I enjoy having sex.  I enjoy going to dance weekends.  I rarely experience the feeling during sex or dance weekends that I would rather be doing something else, which is a feeling I get, say, while I'm at work, or even during a weekend at home, which suggests that sex and dance weekends are more enjoyable than work.  Confusingly, though, I don't seem to be optimizing for these much.  I've been to five dance weekends in the last year; I could easily have been to twice that many.  With only a little more inconvenience I could rearrange my life so I have a lot more sex than I do now.  But I don't.

So what am I optimizing for?  There are things that make me feel "happy" with my life that aren't enjoyment:

* Looking back on past accomplishments that I think are meaningful

* Remembering good times in the past

* Working on goals that are important to me

* Looking forward to enjoyable things in the future

I think these are all part of what we say when we talk about having a "meaningful" or "satisfying" life, as opposed to just a "happy" one.

However, for my life to have these properties, I necessarily need to give up some minute-to-minute enjoyment.  Having satisfying accomplishments probably means overcoming at least a little bit of adversity.  Having meaningful goals means having some part of the world that is not already exactly how you want it to be.  To look forward to enjoyment in the future, I at least have to not be having that same type of enjoyment now.

I'm happy with this tradeoff.  As I mentioned, I could spend a lot more time on minute-to-minute enjoyable things, but I choose not to in favor (among other things) of being able to invest more energy in work, which is tied up in my long term goals.  I also expect to continue to do this.  For example, I want to have children in spite of the morning sickness and screaming babies necessarily involved because I expect it to be a challenging, meaningful project that will bring me a lot of satisfaction.

## Is there such a thing as too good a world?
Sometimes I dream about living in a gender-free utopia, free of expectations that women should be pretty and polite and men should be aggressive.  This would solve a lot of problems I have now.

But living in a gender-free utopia would also rob me of experiences I find meaningful.  I don't shave my legs, but in middle school and high school, I didn't really feel like that was an option.  Today, my hairy legs make me feel powerful, since I overcame a lot of social pressure to have them.  In a perfect gender-free utopia I would still not shave my legs, but I wouldn't get much satisfaction from it.  Even given my negative experiences around it when I was younger, I definitely prefer to keep my current experience with body hair.  And yet I'm passionate about making body hair acceptable for women, and thereby robbing other people of an experience I consider positive.

I don't think the world shouldn't be better for women or racial minorities or disabled people.  This is why I try to combat stereotypes that apply to me, like that women shouldn't have body hair.  But I do worry that a world where everyone has it easy and no one is different would just not be interesting.  Which is why I hesitate to do the obvious thing and start the blue hair dye factory.

## Luckily, I don't have to figure this out right now.

This is currently just a theoretical problem.  I don't think the world is in any danger of being too good in the near future, and I don't think any of my personal efforts to make the world better run up against this objection (I'm basically 100% sure that people are more able to lead meaningful lives when they don't have malaria, for instance).

It's also possible that this is not a real problem at all ever.  I could be wrong that I wouldn't feel satisfied with my life in a utopia where I never had to overcome adversity.  It could also be the case that the amount of adversity you have to overcome to feel satisfied with your life is sufficiently small that even inevitable problems like breakups or losing sports games will provide sufficient adversity.  After all, even by local standards, I'm extremely lucky-- I'm paid a lot of money to do something I enjoy doing, good health, familial wealth enough to send me to a fancy college, etc, but I've still had a pretty satisfying life so far.

How do you optimize for giving people meaningful lives?  Surely they should be long and healthy.  Probably they should include many choices, and a fair chance at success in any reasonable endeavor.  Also surely, they should contain some challenges and some hard times.  Should these meaningful lives include gendered beauty expectations?  The echos of generations of racial inquality?  Religious tension?  Online bullying?  Generational conflict?  Charity?  Activism?  I'm not sure.
