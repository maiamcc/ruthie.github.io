title: New Practice Strategy
---

I recently started listening to and immitating professional recordings as one of my main practice strategies, and I'm really pleased with how it's going.  

I've long understood that having structure will help me focus my practice.  I've tried some structures before--polishing a tune to record on my computer, making lists of tunes or techniques to focus on--but without much success, so I'm excited to have finally found something that works.

## What I've Been Doing

I sit down and choose a recording, and open it up in [audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/).  I choose an iteration of the tune where I can hear the fiddle well and listen to it a few times.  Usually I crop the recording down to just that one iteration for convenience.

After playing the piece through until I have the notes, I choose aspects of the piece to work on one-by-one.  An aspect of the piece might be an ornamentation strategy, a difficult phrase, some aspect of the player's bowing, etc.  A particularly fruitful direction I've found is understanding the rhythm of the piece-- what part of the measure is getting emphasis and how.  Usually I work on the A part until I've worked on all of the aspects I'm going to work on, and then I move on to the B part.

## Successes

The biggest success of this strategy is that I actually use it.  When I've started using new strategies before, I've always lost interest within weeks.  What's worse is that I didn't just stop using my particular strategy--without direction, I practiced a lot less overall.

The second biggest success of this strategy is that now when I practice I'm focussing on something.  I'm not sure if the things I'm focussing on are the most valuable for me, but I'm pretty sure that if I don't try to improve something particular, I basically don't improve.

The other second biggest success is listening closely to what fiddlers I admire are doing.  I'm getting better at identifying what tools players use to create different effects, even if I don't know how to use those tools yet.  I've noticed also some systematic things-- fiddlers I admire emphasize the offbeats more than I do ("one-and-TWO-and" instead of "ONE-and-two-and").

I see signs that I'm improving.  I've learned some new tunes.  I've gotten a lot better at bow tripplets, which I could barely do before.  Bow tripplets appear a lot on recordings, so I'm obliged to play them a lot more, and it turns out that just playing them a lot goes a long way.

I also have a few hints of more important successes.  I've caught myself using things I've learned from recordings on other tunes, but not very often yet.  A couple of times recently my playing has pulled Ben away from whatever he was doing to come accompany me on the piano, which I don't think would happen if I wasn't playing particularly well

## Shortcomings

One problem I'm encountering is that I find that after working hard to master a particular player's version of a tune it's harder to vary it, which I need to do if I'm going to play it eight times through at a contra dance.  More broadly, I'm not doing much concious work on creating my own arrangements, or applying what I'm learning from recordings to other tunes.  I'm fine with this for now, but unless I want to become a robot and play tunes only exactly as I heard them, I may want to spend some more time trying to fix this.

## Refinements

I've found it useful to play recordings at half speed, not only to figure out what's going on with very fast ornaments, which I expected, but also to understand the rhythm, which I didn't.  I've been able to immitate rhythms better by listening to a recording at half speed, playing the tune at that tempo, and then slowly speeding it up until I'm playing at full speed.

It matters which tunes I pick for this exercise.  It helps to have recordings that aren't too busy.  Especially bad are ones where something else is playing in unison with the fiddle, because on these it's much harder to hear the bowing.  The very best tunes include the fiddler doing something very simple very well.  On Elixir's recording of the tune House of Hamill, at the beginning the fiddle does a rhythmic drone on an E like "doot-do-doot-do-do-doot-do-do-doot-do-do-doot."  I enjoyed working on the bow articulation without worrying about a bunch of notes, and then once I started playing the tune, I noticed a lot of similar rhythmic patterns, and I could play them better because I had figured out the pattern on the drone.  It was like Ethan Hazzard-Watkins had put a little fiddle lesson for me in that recording.  I hope to find more recordings with fiddle lessons in them, but I'm not sure this will happen often.

## What about this strategy makes work?

I think this strategy is working so well for me because it gives me guidance that I don't have to generate.  When I try to work on a tune until it's good enough to record, I need to first figure out what part of my playing to work on improving, which I'm not very good at.  I'm more likely to think of things to work on that I've thought about in the past, which are likely the ones I'm already good at, or ones where I'm reaching diminishing marginal returns on.
