title: Why I Care about Bi Visibility
---

I recently asked my bisexual facebook friends about how they approach bi visibility.  I got a lot of interesting answers, but the most liked comment on the thread was my own answer to the question of why I wanted visibility.  Most of what I have found on the internet about this is of the poetic, be-yourself strain, [like this one](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heron-greenesmith/why-i-say-im-bisexual_1_b_4590176.html).  While I like these, I tend to crave more concrete explanations, so I thought I'd post my answers more publicly.

* I like hanging out with queer people and talking about queer things, and being visible, especially to other queer people, helps me find these friends and conversations.  When I asked my friends about this, "community" was by far the most mentioned reason to want to be visible.

* With friends I've had a long time who don't know I'm bi, I have a really hard time mentioning it, even when it's relevant to the conversation.  I don't like disrupting people's well-established images of me, and this experience makes me pretty uncomfortable.

* I feel strongly about creating space for other people like me. I'm not overwhelmingly affected by people's assumptions about me (or lack thereof) but I think that there are other people who are, because they're less comfortable with people's assumptions, or less likely to out themselves when the time comes. I spend time in spaces where no one has a problem with my sexuality, but where people also assume everyone is straight by default.  Being visibly bisexual erodes that assumption, and makes it both easier to come out and easier to stay quiet without worrying that people's incorrect impressions are becoming more entreanched.

One reason that I might have put on this list a couple of years ago is ease of partner finding, but this isn't a major reason for me, and wasn't mentioned by any of my friends.  While I think visibility probably helps, I think it's far from necessary (I think my past self viewed it as much harder to find same-gender partners while being relatively quiet about my sexuality than it actually was).  I have the power to come out to a potential partner whenever I want, and same-gender people who are interested in me are the least likely people to make assumptions, and the most likely people to pick up on subtle hints.
