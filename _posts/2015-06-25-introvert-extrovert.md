title: This Thing that Bothers me on the Internet

I really really don't get the introvert/extrovert thing.  People will ask me, are you an introvert or an extrovert?

No.

Then they say, to clarify, "well do you gain energy or lose energy from being around people?"

No.  I gain energy from eating food and sleeping.  I lose energy from exercising and staying up late.

"Well, you know what I mean."

Oh, so you're trying to ask me whether being around people affects my mood?  Sure yeah.  I have felt totally drained after five hours of job interviews, happy and relaxed after five days of vacation with my family, energized after a weeklong retreat with my coworkers, lonely after a week as the only young person music camp, exhilerated after a day of contra dancing, overstimulated after a party where I meet a lot of new people, and satisfied after a long evening with my friends.  On the flip side, I have felt relaxed and thoughtful after a long walk by myself, but antsy after a day where I don't leave my home.

How I feel around other people depends on a lot of things.  How many other people?  How well do I know them?  What are we doing?  Do I think they're judging me?  Are we indoors or outdoors?  Can I move around and talk to different people, or do I have to stay in one place (like because I'm in a car, or I have the inside seat in a booth at a restaurant)?  Am I hungry?  Tired?  Souped up on endorphins after exercising?  Is the interaction scripted, or do you need to make it up?  I worked at a nice fast food restaurant in high school, and I usually felt great after interacting with customers for a few hours-- you smile, you give them their food, and they thank you for it.  Or are we just sitting around together working?  You'd think this would be neutral, but the presence of other people can be comforting on the one hand or annoying and distracting on the other.  I find a surprising amount of my feelings towards social situations are explained by how loud the environment is.  If I'm in a noisy restaurant, and I have to concentrate on other people to hear what they're saying, I tire a lot more quickly.

So I know that people have the bias of thinking that everyone else is like them, but it stretches my imagination that most people are not only unlike me, but much much simpler in this respect.  That's not to say that no one is clearly an introvert or clearly an extrovert, but the idea that that's everyone, or even most people is bizarre.

My social circle is pretty good at questioning false binaries, even ones with much longer social histories.  It surprises (and annoys) me how much screen space this particular one gets.
