Sometimes I think things that I think are interesting.  I now have a blog to record and share those thoughts.

# Goals for this project

* Clarify my thoughts by writing them down

I spend a noticable amount of my life just thinking about things, and that time doesn't contribute to anything concrete that I can look at later.  In fact, I think I mostly just forget about what I thought about in the past.  Writing down thoughts will hopefully turn thinking things into something with concrete positive

* Interact with other people over things I'm thinking about

In the past, talking to people about what I'm thinking about has helped me develop my thoughts further and understand the things I'm thinking about better.  A persistent and public place to do that will allow me to interact on demand with people who want to think about the same things as I do.

* Social validation

I enjoy the feeling I get every time someone likes my facebook status.  I expect it to be even more exciting to have comments on something that I worked hard to create.

# Non-goals

* Posting regularly

I don't have a particular desire to post with a certain frequency, or an aversion to not posting for months and then coming back.  This could change, but for now, no goal that I have is dependent on my posting regularly, and now that my website is set up, most of the work to maintain it is proportional to how much I use it.
