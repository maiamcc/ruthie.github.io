title: Preparing to Play for Contra Dances
---

My boyfriend [Ben](http://benkuhn.net) and I have been booked to play [Circle Left Contra Dance](http://www.lcfd.org/sf/circleleft.html) in September.  This is the first time either of us have played for a dance outside of an open band setting, and Circle Left is a popular dance, especially among my friends (the people who's opinion I care most about), so we've working hard to make sure we do a good job.

We started practicing in May, putting together sets and polishing them.  In early July we went to [BACDS American Week](http://www.bacds.org/camps/amweek2014/) and got to spend a bunch of time talking to people and taking workshops and playing for dancers our plan for preparing changed.  Particularly influential was [Max Newman's](http://www.maxnewman.com/) workshop, "Making Dance Music Danceable", but we also learned a lot from talking to musicians and callers and actually playing for dancers.

Keep in mind reading that our current strategy is a work in progress.  We practice a lot, but don't get to test our success by playing for dancers very often, and it may turn out that we're on the wrong track.

## More tunes, fewer polished sets

We originally planned to prepare a polished set every week this summer.  Some of these we posted on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/stolen-goods-contra) and facebook and asked for feedback.  We got some good feedback this way, but I think the main effect of that decision was that it helped enforce that we were satisfied with our final recordings.

For the first time at American Week, we actually had to match tunes with dances, and we discovered that it was harder to find good matches than we expected.  We had thought about preparing sets with a variety of moods, but we didn't think about other aspects of how a tune fits with a dance, like phrase length and balance placement.  Some of this can be added with how you play the music, but that doesn't work if you have arranged sets.  We decided to move away from the arranged set approach and try to expand our repretoir of tunes we felt comfortable playing.

The other influence on this decision were new things I learned about how callers program.  It seems like most callers pick dances as they go along depending on the mood of the hall, instead of programming ahead of time.  At one point we thought about asking the caller at our first dance if we could look at the dances ahead of time.  I think it's less likely we'll do that now, since it seems like a caller might feel overly restricted by having arranged sets with the band.

## Fewer Variations, More Repetition

One thing Max Newman pointed out to us is that dancers don't have their whole attention on the music, so they need a lot less interest and variety than we assumed.  As a rule of thumb, any musical idea we have we should repeat at least twice.  This discovery was a great relief to me because it was hard for me to come up with five or more variants on every tune, especially with just fiddle and piano for instrumentation.

## Passion Graphs

In his workshop, Max Newman showed us the idea of the "passion graph" of a dance set.  A passion graph is the visual representation of the arch of the set.  For example, a common pattern is to start high energy, bring the energy down in the middle, and then end with a lot of energy, like this:

<p align="middle"><img src="/images/example_passion_graph.jpg" width="70%"/></p>

A common antipattern is a wiggly passion graph, that starts somewhere in the middle and goes up and then down and then up and then down.
  

<p align="middle"><img src="/images/antipattern_passion_graph.jpg" width="70%"/></p>

I think our first arranged sets had this problem.  We would just think of as many variations as we could and order pretty arbitrarily.  Now, when we start playing, we'll often draw the passion graph we're aiming for in the air with our fingers before starting.

## Where to Put the Energy

It's usually easier to add a balance to a smooth section of tune than to take one away from an inherently choppy tune.  On the other hand, playing smoothly through a balance is usually no big deal to the dancers, whereas playing bouncy or choppy music when the dancers need smooth music can be really frustrating.  We should probably lean towards preparing more smooth sets and count on our ability to add bounce in appropriate places if need be.

## Marking the Phrases

Very smooth dances sometimes have the problem that the dancers' timing gets mushy.  It helps if the musicians make it very clear where the phrases start and end, and choose tunes with very clear phrasing.  I really like the Crowfoot tune Twinflower, which has a beautiful wandering melody, and would like to play it for dances, but if and when that ever happens it can't be for something too flowy or else the dancers won't know where they are.

## Communicating While we Play

We need to work on communicating while we play.  A lot of variations we want to require coordination (e.g. one of us dropping out).  I have a hard time talking while I play; it feels like playing music uses up my verbal loop.  I've practiced a little, and managed to get a few words out without totally flubbing the rhythm, but this is something I really need to improve more on.

## What Else?

Are there things we haven't thought about, or ways we should be preparing that we aren't?
