title: Contra dance, Consent, and Social Grace
---

There are some moments that come up regularly in contra dance that I've struggled to find good ways to navigate.  This weekend, I went to a dance in a new city, and a whole bunch of these came up.  I'm mostly happy with how I dealt with them, although there are some I wish I had done better.

## Not booking ahead

Some dancers (especially at some dances) will "book ahead" and promise dances besides the one that's about to happen to particular partners.  It's generally frowned upon; [Jeff Kauffman's experience](http://www.jefftk.com/p/booking-ahead-at-contras) gives a good idea of why people frown upon it, and also why it can be good, or at least tempting.  My policy is to book ahead only for people I've never danced with before, or people who I don't expect to see again for a long time.

At this dance, I booked ahead with one person under this policy.  After I agreed to dance I told him what my policy was, so that he knows he won't get to book me again.  He also asked me why I have my policy.  I told him that I had seen it abused (which is true), but I wish that I had said something like "I think not booking ahead makes dances more welcoming."  This would give him an idea of what I want to acheive instead of what I want to avoid, and given him a better idea that booking ahead might be a problem, even in his community.

## Saying no to dances

I think it's always ok to [say no to a dance](http://www.benkuhn.net/contra-etiquette).  I don't implement this idea often because (a) a lot of people consider it rude, and I don't want to alienate people in my community (b) I want to be very careful not to use this rule to unfairly avoid dancing with certain kinds of people (e.g. people outside of my demographic) and (c) I'm very rarely actually asked to dance by someone who I actively don't want to dance with.

I got two chances to practice saying no at this dance.  Unfortunately, in both cases I had to reiterate my "no."  In one case I'm not sure I could have been clearer:

> "Do you want to hambo?"

> "No, thank you."

> "Do you know how to hambo?"

> "Yes, but I don't want to right now."

> "Why won't you hambo?"

> "Just... no thank you."

In the other case, I could have been clearer, but at the expense of expressing a more complex idea.  I had been asked to dance by someone I had met before, and while we were lining up he asked me for the waltz also.  I said he could have the contra or the waltz but not both.  He said things that made it clear that he understood, but he still tried to find me for the waltz later.  If I had just said "no, thanks" he might have gotten the message.  I'm sorry to have learned that conditionals may be too complex for clear communication in these situations, because they could help these situations end in better outcomes (a good waltz partner is much harder to find than a good contra dance partner!), but I think this is what I have learned.

## Ask before dipping

I prefer if people ask me before dipping me for the first time.  I like being dipped, but not everyone does, so I consider asking first an important piece of etiquette.  Two people dipped me without asking first.  In both cases, I told them in a pleasant tone "I prefer if you ask before dipping."  Both people acknowledged this, didn't seem offended, didn't seem to think I was more offended than I was, and carried on dancing.

## Deflecting out of line comments

This was my least successful communication of the evening.  I asked my waltz partner where he learned to waltz backwards (I was actually curious if he was a Scandinavian dancer, because this is something that Scandinavian dancers do).  He said "with you, my dear."  I think this kind of flirtatious comment is usually meant well, but it makes me a bit uncomfortable.  The best I could do was to say "that's not true" and shrug it off, but I wish I could do better.  Maybe something like my approach to being dipped would work, but I can't think of a clear formulation of what I'm asking them not to do.  Please don't flirt with me?  Please don't call me "my dear"?  If anyone has done something that worked well in this kind of situation, I'd love to hear about it.

## Gender free dancing at a gendered dance

The first dance of the evening I danced with a young man who was moderately new to contra.  I guessed that he had only lead before, so I said "I assume you want to lead?"  He said he wanted to lead this one, but would be up for following one later.  Because it's behavior I want to encourage, and because this person was awesome enough to dance with twice in one night, I agreed.

When that dance happened, he and I were lined up near the back of the line.  The caller called something a little weird (a ladies chain into a rollaway) that confused me.  We ended up in the wrong positions, and didn't manage to recover, no thanks to our non-traditional gender roles.  Most people got what was supposed to happen right away though, and the caller barelled on, not noticing that the end of the line was paralyzed.  

I knew we were lost, I knew my partner probably wouldn't be able to pick up the dance on the fly, and I knew that I had to do a particularly good job of leading, so I did the assertive thing and shouted "we're completely lost!"  The caller stopped, helped us by making us parade all the way to the top to put us with a couple who got it the first time (embarrasing!), and let them demo the move that derailed us, and then we were on our way.

I realize that I delayed the dance, and I might have been able to figure out what was going on without doing this, but I also could have failed to do this and messed up the dance for several sets of neighbors and given my awesome partner a really bad first experience following.  The good things I achieved by doing that were less apparent than the inconvenience I caused everyone else, so I don't think I'm getting many social rewards for that move, but I still think it was the right one.

This incident ended with a bright spot.  Somewhere in this mess, a woman in the next minor set tried to help get us back on track, and she came up to me at the end of the dance and appologized for assuming I was following.  She was instantly forgiven and she now has major respect from me for realizing her mistake and wanting to appologize, and I hope I meet her again and get to dance with her.

## Community Values

A common thread in a lot of the things described here is me trying to encourage social norms that are not already universally accepted.  That's a hard place to be, since plenty of people don't want to change, and will be offended if you ask them to.  I want to maintain my choice of who to dance with, and keep contra a safe and welcoming space for others, while also not making the other people I share this space with unduly unhappy.  I haven't always been good at this, and I'm excited to be getting more successful at walking those lines.
