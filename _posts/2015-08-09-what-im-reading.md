title: What I've been Reading

Here are all of the non-fiction things I've been reading recently (I promise the fiction things have been both fewer and less interesting).

## Clandestine In Chile: The Adventures of Miguel Littín (Gabrial Garcia Marquez)

This book (ghostwritten by Gabriel Garcia Marquez) recounts how Littín, a well known Chilean filmmaker exiled during the military dictatorship of 1970s, returned to Chile disguized as a Uruguayan businessman to make a film about Chile.  I picked it up in the bookstore because I'm interested in that part of history because it produced [a lot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inti-Illimani) [of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ADctor_Jara) [music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violeta_Parra), and because I thought it might contain cool adventure stories.

On the cool adventure stories front I was a bit disappointed.  Besides some awkward conversations with policemen and a lot of getting in and out of cars going in different directions, there's not much adventure here.  Littín wasn't very careful, but it seems like even a military dictatorship isn't that good at finding a well disguized operative.  Mostly the book consists of Gabriel Garcia Marquez waxing poetic about Chile before and after the coup.

My favorite passage was right at the beginning, where Littín describes how uncomfortable he felt in his Uruguayan businessman disguise.  He describes feeling unlike himself, and I've experienced something similar when I have to dress in certain ways, particularly for "formal" occasions like job interviews, and I was interested to find this experience described so well in such a different context.

## Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty (Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo)

This is a classic in the genre of applying evidence to fighting global poverty.  It mostly consists of study after study working out what works and what doesn't to make peoples' lives better in the developing world, organized to pull out more generalizeable insights.  I've kind of hung around people who think about this a lot and it still had lots of information that was new to me.  If you're interested in global poverty and somehow haven't read it, I obviously recommend it, and I also recommend it if you're interested more broadly in human society and behavior.  Most of our anecdotal dataset about how people behave comes from well off people in developed nations, and it's interesting to see how people behave and what systems they make to work together to survive in a very different situation.
 
## Gang Leader for a Day (Sudhir Venkatesh)

This is a book written by an anthropology grad student about how he spent his grad school years-- making frieds with a gang leader and hanging around the projects in Chicago.  It discusses the day-to-day lives of the people in the projects, and also the power dynamics between the gangs and other community leaders in the projects.  It's also extremely fast paced and hard to put down.

One focus I found interesting was on the informal economies inside the building the author hung around.  In particular, I was struck by the similarity between these and the informal economies in developing countries.  It's not surprising in retrospect, but people do a lot of the same things-- buy big containers of food and resell in small amounts for a profit, take care of each-others children for money, and use bribery when formal systems fail.

Reading this book also made me wonder what good accounts of life in a gang, or living in the projects is like from a more insider perspective.  I appreciate that this book focusses on aspects of life that are most surprising to me as an outsider, but I also imagine that Venkatesh misses parts of that experience that someone who actually had it would be able to identify.  If you've read books along these lines that you found interesting, I want to hear about them.

## Money, Real Quick: The Story of M-Pesa (Tonny K. Omwansa and Nicholas P. Sullivan)

M-Pesa is this system in Kenya which essentially allows users to text each-other money.  It's also the system that Wave sends money to to.  This is a short book, and it reads like a kind of repetitive promotional pamphlet for M-Pesa, but it's informative in a kind of repetitive promotional way.  On the other hand, it's probably the best book on M-Pesa ever written, so if you're interested in modern money transfer in East Africa, you don't actually have many other choices.

## The Anti-Politics Machine (James Ferguson)

This is hardcore academic anthropology (or at least, way more hard core than what I usually read).  It discusses a long running, multi-million-dollar, unsuccessful development project in Lesotho (that little country surrounded on all sides by South Africa).  Ferguson argues (I think convincingly) that the project failed not simply because of incopetence, but because of the way it and similar projects are framed.  

This book is long and dry and I learned a lot about how people of Lesotho think about owning cows.  On the other hand, I appreciated its thoroughness and all the stuff about cows came around to the main point.  This book successfully made me feel the need to view develpoment projects more skeptically, but it didn't make me want to give up on the whole idea (something the author clearly advocated, although he didn't pretend to say that the book was a complete case for this), and since going to the developing world and spending years deeply understanding people's needs is not particularly on the table for me, I'm going continue to outsource my thinking on what development projects are worth supporting to [other people](http://www.givewell.org).
