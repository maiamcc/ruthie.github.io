title: Being Almost Alone
---
This weekend I went to [Queer Contra Camp](http://www.lcfd.org/sf/DanceCamp/wcamp14.html).  It was basically a tornado of the most joyful things I do in life with the most welcoming communities I know of.  In fact, it was kind of overwhelmingly so.

I've had this experience at many dance camps, even less superlative ones.  Usually I'm having a good time and dancing and talking to people and at some point a dance ends and I think to myself, is it time for another dance, or time to take a break and talk to people?  And who do I want to dance with, or talk to?  And then I discover that I don't actually want to dance with or talk to anyone, and the thought of asking someone else to dance sounds kind of unpleasant, and there's no one I really want to dance with right now because I want to make people have fun while they dance and make people like me and all of the things I usually do to make that happen sound hard and why is there so much sound in here, and everyone else seems to be having so much fun so how come I feel so LONELY?  Then I know it's time to take a break.

My first instinct, and a strategy I've taken many times, is to go somewhere where I will literally be alone.  In a room.  By myself.  With no one else there.  However, this has rarely been effective at making me want to be around people again.  After an hour of alone time I often come back to the dance hall only to find I really just want more alone time.

This weekend I discovered the alternate strategy of spending time with a few other people, and found that it works a lot better.  A couple of times when I was feeling overwhelmed, I took a hike with a couple of other people and came back feeling refreshed and happy.  And not wanting to go away again immediately.

Looking back, I remember taking the same walk-with-one-or-two-people strategy at student group retreats in college.  On these retreats, the group would rent a house in the woods to spend a weekend having important, often stressful policy discussions, and they were unlike dance camps in about every way except that both are intensely social.  When we had a long break from discussions, the group tended to explode into sets of two and three walking in different directions.  In an hour we would come back having vented our feelings and sit down to another important, stressful policy discussion.

I'm not sure what about talking to just one or two other people serves as a social reset button.  Verbalizing my thoughts probably forces me to organize my thoughts in a way that being by myself does not.  Being around a few people I'm familiar with lets me relax the self-policing I need to do when I'm around big groups that I don't know well, without relaxing my social muscle entirely.  Or it may be that trying to create connections erodes my feeling that I already have them, and talking to an individual for a while rebuilds that feeling.

In any case, I intend to use this insight at future very-very-social events.
