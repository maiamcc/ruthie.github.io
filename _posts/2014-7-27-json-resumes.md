title: JSON resumes
---

A coworker recently showed me [this](http://jsonresume.org/).  The idea is that instead of creating PDF resumes from scratch, we could encode the information in a well defined format, and then use generic tools to display and distribute resumes.

The most exciting part of this in my mind is the idea that resume information could be distributed raw, and displayed in standardized ways to humans or even initially consumed by computers.

The practice of putting a lot of effort into a designed resume is annoying.  The last time I did a job search, I put five or ten hours into this that I could have spent elsewhere.  If I was a particularly conciencious job seeker, employers might have learned that from a nice resume, but since most job seekers put comparable effort in, this doesn't happen.  

Five or ten hours of lost time is the worst of it for me, because I won the job-seeking game.  What of those who missed the memo about pretty resumes, or don't have taste that matches their potential employers?  Ability to come up with a socially acceptable resume is a very poor proxy for qualification for almost any job, but it seems to have an outsize effect.

Standardized resume formats would also be one small step in the direction of more systematic hiring processes.  There is both [research](http://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html) and [anecdata](http://whatwouldkingleonidasdo.tumblr.com/post/54989171152/how-i-discovered-gender-discrimination) show that people are treated differently in hiring processes based on their names.  If a company replaced a resume screen by hand with an automated one, they could no longer unintentionally discriminate based on gender or race.

Distributing raw data instead of pretty resumes is not a single-edged-sword.  It might make it harder for people with non-traditional backgrounds to get a second look.  Until good tools become available to construct JSON resumes, it might be difficult for non-techy people to even make a resume this way.  On the whole though, I think that this would be a positive change.
