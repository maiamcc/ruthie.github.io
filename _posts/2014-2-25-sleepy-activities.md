title:  What to do when I'm tired
---

I have (what feels like) very little free time, and lots of fiddle practice, contra dancing, friend phone-calling, Splash website work, etc, to do.  I'm always looking for (even little) ways I can get more time to do things I care about.

One of the types of time I'm looking to use better is the late evenings, from about 8:00 to 9:30 or 10:00, when I start getting ready for bed.  When I'm tired, my brain stops being very good for not only intellectual, but also non-intellectual work.  Example:  this weekend I washed my sheets, and they came out of the dryer at 10:00 PM.  I tried to put them on my bed before going to sleep, but gave up halfway through because I wanted to sleep on a bed without sheets more than I wanted to put sheets on my bed.

When I come home from work, I tend to start doing something I want to do and but somehow find myself on facebook or staring at the ceiling and thinking.  I'd love to use this time to do things I care about, but so far haven't been successful.

Some strategies I've considered to use this time better:

## Go to sleep

I could go to bed hours earlier than I actually do.  If I did this, I would probably also wake up earlier and have more high-mental-energy time to before work.

There are a few problems with this plan.  When I sleep may be a zero-sum game.  If I go to bed earlier, I'll also be more tired earlier in the evening.  This plan will also probably go badly on evenings when I do social things that run late.  If my usual bedtime is 9:00 PM, and I do a social thing until 1:00 AM I've stayed up four hours later than usual, and I'm pretty sure my sleep schedule is not elastic enough to just compensate.

## Do low-focus things that I need to do  

I've definitely tried this, but with discouraging results.  I don't do things, or do them slowly and/or badly.  However, this is an attractive enough option that I don't want to write it off as impossible without some real effort.  

One strategy I haven't tried is to delay not just easy tasks, but fun ones for the evening.  I'm less likely to end up on facebook if my goal is to organize my music collection or call friends on the phone, because I enjoy doing these things and have an easier time sticking to them.  Similarly, if I did things which kept me away from the computer, like cooking or exercising, I'd be less likely to end up on facebook.

## Do things that I wouldn't otherwise do

There are plenty of things that I don't do because I don't consider them high enough priority, but would still prefer to ceiling staring.  Examples:
- Reading (I read, just not that much)
- Knitting (an old hobby I haven't done much of lately)
- Listening to music, especially music of the type I want to be better at making
- Having dinner with friends

## Or just keep doing what I'm doing

Last, but not least, maybe I should just embrace ceiling staring.  Based on past experience, it might be hard to eliminate entirely, and I actually find it pretty pleasant.  At its best, the thinking I do while staring at the ceiling could lead to interesting conversations, blog posts, or just general life improvement.
