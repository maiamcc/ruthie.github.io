title: College without the Classes
---
I'm glad I went to college for a bunch of reasons.  I got to spend time around a peer group selected to have similar interests to mine.  The prestige of my institution helped me get internships and a job when I graduated.  I got involved in the student group which ran [Splash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash!), which gave me valuable experience organizing events and managing people, and sparked an interest in teaching.  Oh yeah, and I took some classes.  While I can think of a many specific things I learned in classes and I remember enjoying some of them a lot, I also put a ton of effort and stress into my classes, and it's not clear to me whether I learned more through them than I would have learned by other doing things.

There's this thing called the [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/become-a-fellow/about-the-program/).  Young people are paid $50,000 a year not to go to college and take classes for two years.  Instead they found companies and do scientific research and write books and otherwise educate themselves.  

In theory, this option is open to any student.  Out-of-state or private college costs (nominally) $50,000 a year-- you could just not go to college and pocket the money.  In practice, though, this isn't an option for most people.  First, most students don't actually pay $50,000 a year for college; they go to in-state schools or have scholarships or financial aid.  Second, few parents would be willing to pay college tuition in order for their child not to go to college.

What if you had a college with no classes?  Students could live in dorms, socialize together and form student organizations, but instead of taking classes they could start companies or do scientific research or write books.  The institution could provide support by having faculty to advise students, space, and other resources.  Prestige is a little harder to acquire, but some new educational institutions, like [Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu/) seem to have acquired a lot of prestige fairly quickly, and I suspect such an unusual institution as this one could pull it off without a lot of trouble.

Such an institution would have all the advantages of college except for the classes, and with a form factor a little more like college, parents might be more willing to financially support their children doing whatever they want for four years.
