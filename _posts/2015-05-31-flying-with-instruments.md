title: My Dirty Secret about Traveling with Instruments
---

You must not, under any circumstances, tell any airline personelle that I said this.

The truth is, when push comes to shove, I will never literally forfeit my seat on an airplane because I have to check my fiddle.

My fiddle is unique and irreplaceable.  My fiddle is also in a lot more danger under the plane than in the cabin.  It's sensitive to temperature changes, being dropped long distances, and of course to the general rough handling that baggage gets.  But it's not in that much danger.  It's been checked before without incident, when I was carrying my even more valuable and more fragile nyckelharpa on board.  I have a good case that protects it pretty well from rough handling.  If the bridge fell over, or the body was cracked, I could bike over to the neighborhood luthier and have it fixed for a few hundred dollars.  Maybe not quite as good as new if it was badly damaged, but close.  There are worse scenarios (it could get lost or stolen) but I think those are unlikely enough that I'm justified in not worrying about them.

More importantly, as unique and irreplaceable as my instrument is, my time is also unique and irreplaceable.  If I miss a plane, that could be an evening of dancing I never get back, or dinner with a friend, or just some much-needed rest at home after a trip.

Fundamentally, I have a fiddle so I can use it, including using it in places I have to fly to.  If protecting my instrument makes it difficult for me to bring it places, it's defeated it's own purpose (I feel a similar way about leaving instruments on chairs while I go to the bathroom at jams.

An obvious note: while this is how I feel about my instruments, and while I think a lot of people could buy a fancy case and relax about this issue, there are plenty of people who shouldn't take this risk, and only they can make that decision.  My decision is based on a cost/benifit analysis of missing a plane vs. a small risk of an injured instrument.  The costs and benefits of both sides of this equation can be completely different, and extremely personal, for other people.

A less obvious, but potentially useful note:  I have never been forced to gate check my fiddle.  I have been given a lot of gate check tags for it that I proceeded to put in my pocket while waiting on the jet bridge.  I have also had some fun conversations with flight attendants getting them to make room in the overhead bin, or put my instrument in the first class closet.  I have even stood at the top of the cabin and yelled asking for a volunteer to gate check their suitcase so I could keep my instrument on the plane.  It turns out that the overhead bins are rarely as full as you think, and a little squishing of the coats and purses will make space for fiddle case no problem.
