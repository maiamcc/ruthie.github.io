title: Remembering the Manhunt
---

A year ago last Friday Boston and Cambridge residents were asked to stay in their homes for a day while police searched for the Boston Marathon bombers.  Like a lot of particularly emotional days, this one sticks out in my memory.

It was one of the only times since moving to my apartment in Inman Square that I missed living in a dorm.  My place felt isolated, and the sense of crisis around me made me crave the company of the people I cared about.

It wasn't so much that I felt compelled to stay inside.  I lived a stone's throw from Somerville, which was in theory not under the same recommendation to stay inside as Cambridge.  A few people were on the streets outside my window.  My friends were sending pannicked messages to each other online, but privately, I thought they were treating it like a bigger emergency than it really was.

But I had nowhere to go.  I might have gone to the dorm where my boyfriend at the time lived, but their housemasters had asked them not to admit non-residents.  Businesses around me were closed.  Friends who I would have visitted encouraged me to stay inside.

The man hunt scared me, but not in the way it seemed to scare the people around me.  I wasn't afraid to leave my home.  I was scared because so many people were.  The police "warning" actually kept the vast majority of Bostonians inside.  I don't want to it to be true that our fear of terrorism can shut down a city and keep us away from the things we want to be doing and the people we care about.
