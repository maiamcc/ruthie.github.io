title: Questions I Think About
---

They are big enough such that I can't answer them in an afternoon, but small enough that I expect to be able to at least make some headway in a lifetime.  Questions that can be answered in an afternoon I just answer.  Questions that can't be answered in a lifetime I don't even start on.  These are the in-between sized questions.  They are the things that I think about while I'm walking places or doing dishes or lying in bed staring at the ceiling.  They are the questions that some of my favorite conversations hinge around.

* How can we effectively teach computer skills that don't revolve around programming, especially to beginners?

* How do individual folk artists view their relationship to the traditions they practice?  How should they?

* How can I connect to people who are much older or much younger than me?

* How can we create communities which value excellence without pushing away less experienced or less talented people?

* What roles do exclusive spaces and institutions play in communities?  Can we fill those roles without exclusivity?  How?

* How do people navigate the boundaries of communities?

* Does identity have to be public?  How do people reconcile the differences between how they think of themselves and how they present themselves?

* To what extent do we choose our identities, especially with respect to gender and sexuality?

* What is gender for, if people of different genders aren't different in concrete ways (or are they)?

* How should I evaluate arguments that aren't framed consequentially?  For example, cultural appropriation is frequently critiqued, but mostly in theoretical terms.  Should I take those arguments seriously?
