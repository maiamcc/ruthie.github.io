title:  Why Living off Campus was the Best Decision I Made at MIT
---

In high school, I seemed to be pretty smart.  I got good grades, did well at math competitions and Quiz Bowl tournaments, and got big numbers on standardized tests.  So of course I applied to competitive colleges and ended up going to MIT.  At MIT, everyone had a high school experience like mine, so suddenly, instead of being one of the smartest people around, I was more middle-of-the-road.  As you can imagine, this transition was pretty bad for my self esteem, and by my sophomore year most of my emotional energy was going into protecting it from the ongoing onslaught.

How do you deal with this situation?  "I compare myself to others too much" seems to be a common problem in general, and "I compare myself to others to the point that it gets in the way of my life" is an alarmingly common problem at places like MIT.  I had this problem (although not as severely as many) and I think I was more successful than most at dealing with it.

One extremely useful thing I did that not many students at MIT do was getting an appartment off campus.  At MIT, most students live in dorms for all four years and my friends thought my appartment ten minutes from campus might as well have been on the moon.

And in a way, it was.  The people walking past my door didn't care about how many classes a semester I was taking.  Most of them didn't go to MIT or anywhere like it, but they still lived good lives, went to work, walked their dogs, and hung out with friends.

I'd like to say I spent more of my social time outside of MIT after moving (that would have been a good idea), but I don't think that happened, at least not at first.  I was, however, spending more of my eating and drinking coffee and getting exercise and running errands time outside of MIT, and just bumping shoulders in line with a wider variety of people helped me remember how much more there is to life than how smart you are.
