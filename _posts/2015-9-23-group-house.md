title: Putting Together a Group House
---

Ben and I have wanted to live in a group house for a while.  Last month, we finally acheived that goal!  We are now living in a five-bedroom in Oakland with four other wonderful people.  It's been a long journey, and sometimes a stressful one, but we think it's well worth it.

# What we did when

## Putting together a group

Our first email-feelers looking for housemates went out in late May and early June.  We started by emailing people we knew were looking for housing, but quickly expanded to people whose housing situations we didn't know about.  We found three of the four people we were looking for this way, via two first degree connections and one second degree connection.  In mid-June I posted on facebook that I was looking for housemates, and found another friend-of-a-friend who was interested.  We all met up and everyone liked her, so we were set with a group.

One thing that made housemate-finding harder than otherwise was that me and Ben have two very different social circles.  Neither of us wanted a house entirely drawn from the other's circle, so we had to find people from both circles who were happy living in a house that straddled those communities.  We succeeded, but it added a layer of complexity and awkwardness to the search.

## Give notice at our old place

We had to give six weeks notice at our old place, which meant that we had to give notice before we had a house lined up.  We also had to be out of our house by August 1st, and we were considering either an August or a September lease, so we lined up temporary housing with friends for the month of August.

## Finding a house

The house-finding process was substantially complicated for us by the fact that me and Ben were in Kenya for the middle two weeks of July.  We watched Craigslist and went to some open houses before we left, and our housemates continued the search with documents from us available to show potential landlords if needed.  The Bay Area housing market is competitive by reputation, but we rejected at least three houses, and no landlord rejected us (we only filled out applications for the house we eventually rented).

The house we eventually rented is not particularly large or nice, and is in a less convenient location that one might hope, but is almost half of the price we expected we'd pay.  We also got it on a short timeline-- we saw the house, applied, and signed the lease all within about a week.

## Moving, moving again, buying appliances.

On August 1st, Ben and I picked up a U-Haul, signed the lease, did the walkthrough, and then moved our furniture in.

One of the quirks of this house was that it didn't come with some of the usual appliances, like a stove or a refrigerator.  So even though we were able to move our furniture in on August 1st, we spent a couple of weeks at the temporary housing we had lined up.

Although we had originally planned to hang around with our friends for most of the month, we realized we were tired of being transient, and we moved fully into the new place as soon as there we had appliances there.

## Replace a roommate

After a few weeks in the new house, one of our housemates was having mold allergies badly enough that she decided to leave.  This housemate search was much easier.  Everyone left posted on facebook, and we generated several leads.  We had one particularly promising one, who already knew about half of the house, and he decided to move in before we got to consider any others.

# What I would do differently

This was not the most fun process I have ever been through.  The uncertainty about my housing situation stressed me out for most of June and July, and the feeling of not really having a livable home made me impatient for most of August.  I think the majority of this is the inescapable reality of moving, but some of it could have been easier.  In particular:

* We should have looked for a house before or in parallel with looking for housemates.  Looking for a house without a full group set is probably a little harder, since some landlords want to vett the whole group, but looking for housemates without a house is also hard.  Anyone who signed on to our group pre-house had to be ok with the max price we were willing to pay, and with the least attractive neighborhood.  It was also stressful ta have to juggle everyone's preferences while looking for the house.

* When talking to potential housemates, we held pretty firm that we weren't willing to restrict our search by neighborhood or price, but our last-added housemate had a couple of more ideosyncratic constraints-- she has strong mold allergies and had a hip injury which meant that she couldn't handle a lot of stairs.  In retrospect, the stairs constraint in particular was pretty restrictive, and it's not clear why we were ok with that but not narrowing down to fewer neighborhoods or lowering our max price.

* I would have taken more time off work to set up the house.  Having missing appliances, and having the livingroom unusable while we were painting were a big drag on my happiness for the first month plus we lived in the house.
