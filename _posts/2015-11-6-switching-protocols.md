title: More Things I'm Learning about Playing for Contra Dances
---

I have a new band!  Since last summer I've been playing with John-Michael Seng-Wheeler and Christopher Jacoby in a band called Switching Protocols (it's a nerd reference).  We've played a number of dances around the Bay Area and generally are having lots of fun.

It's also been a particularly great learning experience for me because, unlike me or Ben, Christopher Jacoby is an actually experienced contra dance musician, so I get to see what someone who knows what the fuck they're doing thinks about.

## More rhythm options

As a melody player, my model of what rhythm players do has always been a little weak, so this may not be news to actual contra dance rhythm players.

In my impoverished model of contra dance rhythm playing (well, piano playing), you have about two rhythmic options-- rolling octaves and boom-chucks.  But these are just good defaults; you can choose more or less any rhythm you want.  Several Switching Protocols sets have some sort of distinctive pattern that Christopher and John-Michael made up for that particular tune.  Different rhythmic patterns make sets sound more different from each-other, and if they're interesting enough, you can foreground them, and play them with no melody over them at all.

## Save your good tricks

But even if you have a cool rhythm pattern for some tune, you don't usually want to start out with it, or play it all the way through.  This goes for any neat trick you do-- it loses its effect if you overuse it.  It's generally better to start out more straight-ahead and bring out the interesting stuff when the dancers have learned the dance and are bored of just hearing the tune over and over again.

## Think about the arc of the dance

I've thought about choosing good kick-ass sets for the two half-closers, but there are other things to think about in terms of when you play your sets.  At the begining, choose straight-ahead sets that you're confident on, while the dancers are warming up (and showing up) and the beginners are figuring out how this works.  The half-closers should obviously be some of your best, highest-energy sets, and to accentuate that, the ones right before can be on the laid-back end.  If you're going to play sets that you're less confident on, or that might be harder to dance to, save them for the second half when everyone is warmed up and most of the beginners have gone home.

Callers also vary on how much and how specifically they've programmed the evening.  Most callers we've worked with had a set of dances in mind ahead of time, and made only minor adjustments, but when this isn't true (because the caller is more flexible, or, in one case, because he lost the program he had made), the band can guide the evening by requesting dances that go with tunes they want to play.

## Think about where you sit

Switching Protocols spent some time experimenting with seating arrangements during rehearsal, and ended up with one that works better for us than our default half circle.  A good arrangement makes it possible to see each-other and hear each-other talk so we can communicate, and also ideally be able to hear each-others instruments without too much help from the monitors.  Monitors are great, but they're often be badly balanced, so it's good to be able to just hear each-other.

## Dynamic range

John-Michael programmed his keyboard to add an extra layer of bass at variable volume when he presses an extra pedal (yes, this is a nerd band, we even program our instruments).  The effect is that he can add more oomph beyond what the keyboard does by default.  And it's really effective!  I can't program my fiddle, but I can work to expand the dynamic range of my playing, both at the high and the low end.

## Less is more

Even with just three instruments, we don't all play all the time, or even close.  Set starts especially don't need much going on.  At one recent gig the caller asked for a "dreamy" set, and we acheived that effect by leaving a lot more space, and it looked really effective (to me sitting on stage).

## Be ready with your waltz

With contras you usually have a good five minutes to get organized while the caller does the walk-through.  With the waltzes, people start being ready to dance within a minute or two of the contra ending.  If you choose your waltz and any arrangement you're going to use before the last contra, you won't leave them waiting.
