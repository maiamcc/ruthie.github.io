title: What I wish I could tell my teenage self about dating
---

When I was in high school, most of what I knew about dating came from movies and school health classes.  All the information about sex I learned in several iterations of sex-ed was important, but wouldn't be useful to me until years after I learned it.  I recognized that a lot of the relationships I saw in movies and read in books was unrealistic, but didn't have a good idea of what real relationships were like.

For all that, I think I had pretty good high level ideas about relationships.  Respect your partner.  Try to make them happy.  Respect yourself.  Try to make yourself happy.  I didn't have any clear idea about how to create relationships like this, though, or really how to create relationships at all.  How do you ask people out?  How do you flirt?  If you go out with someone once, are you dating?  How about after two or three dates.  How do you bring up problems?  How do you break up?

I have some answers to these questions now, maybe even pretty good answers.  I don't have access to my younger self so I can explain things to her, but I may have access to other people with similar difficulties.

Take this advice with a lot of caveats.  My experience dating is relatively narrow.  All of my serious relationships have been monogamous (or almost monogamous), opposite-gender, boyfriend/girlfriend relationships with people I met in person.  The fact that my relationships have all been pretty similar means that I don't know how this advice generalizes.  By the same token, however, similar relationships means I've been able to apply the things I've learned to subsequent relationships, so most of this advice comes from more than one experience.

## Asking People Out

### Don't ask someone out suddenly
I want more than the 20 seconds I get to think when being asked out in person with no warning.  I'm much more likely to make a bad decision (in either direction) when rushed than when I have some time to think.  Alternatives are discussed later in this section.

### Women are allowed to ask men out
Or people of any gender.  This probably goes without saying, but in case it doesn't, it's now been said.

### Flirting
The classic approach to letting people know that you're interested is flirting.  Flirtation is typically ambiguous.  This is ok.  Since all you have to do is make the person you're flirting with wonder whether you're romantically interested, ambiguity is ok.

Flirtation walks a fine line and it's possible to be way too subtle and not be noticed, or way too forward and cross people's boundaries.  If you don't trust yourself to do a good job flirting, just saying things like "I think you're awesome" is a pretty good way to get the message across and is unlikely to make other people uncomfortable.

### It's ok to express affection
Being liked, when the person doing the liking is respectful about it, feels awesome, even when you're not interested that way.  I am still friends with people who have asked me out who I have said no to.  One pitfall to watch out for, though:  make sure it's clear that your happiness doesn't depend on them liking you back.  No one wants to feel on the hook for someone else's happiness.

### Be explicit when asking people out
No matter how explicit you think you've been, there is someone who would not have caught that you had romantic intentions.  Use explicitly romantic language ("date" is a good word).  Be clear that you are asking them out because you are romantically interested in them, not because you need someone to go with you to some event.  

This may be socially uncomfortable, but the alternatives suck more.  It will be very awkward if you have to go on a date with someone who is slowly realizing that this is a date they would never have agreed to.

### Don't coopt a platonic occasion
If you didn't ask someone if they want to go on a date with you (or something similarly explicitly romantic), but you did ask them if they wanted to go hiking with you, or go to a play, or have lunch with you, you should not try to make romantic or sexual advances.  If you profess your love to someone five miles from the car you both need to drive home together in, you and the person you are with are both likely to feel uncomfortable for the next five miles of hiking.  This kind of behavior may also cause your partner to question whether you wanted to be friends with them in the first place or whether this was all about sexual stuff the whole time.  That won't make them like you more.

### Try asking people out over the internet
Doing this gives the person you're asking infinite time to think, without the unpleasant and sometimes judgement-warping possibility of saying no to your face.  As a bonus for you, you have plenty of time to draft an email that's suave and romantic and clear about your intentions.  This may not be as romantic as asking someone out face to face, but I've been asked out this way, and waking up to an email full of smiley faces and an invitation to dinner is also really nice.

### It's ok to ask mutual friends to help mediate
This is especially useful if you feel uncomfortable asking someone out, or you think they might feel uncomfortable being asked out by you.  Friends can feel someone out for you, let you know if that person is very likely not interested for reasons you didn't know, and generally smooth things over.  Remember though that every individual is the arbiter of their own decisions, and you use this technique at your own risk.  Choose a friend whose judgment you trust, and don't mistake a "probably not" for an "absolutely no."

## Setting Relationship Norms

### Ask about all the things:

* What words can I use to describe our relationship?  Boyfriend?  Girlfriend?  Partner?  

* Can I be affectionate towards you in public?  Around your friends?

* Can I be in other relationships at the same time as this one?  Can I hook up with other people?  Make out?  Cuddle?  Flirt?

* How often do you want to spend time together?  Doing what kinds of things?

You don't need to have these conversations all at once, and you have no need to have them at all until you're a couple of weeks into a relationship.  Frontloading them may waste your time if the relationship falls apart early, or make you and your partner feel under pressure to figure things out right away.  Remember with all these questions that the answers can change later if need be.

### Set accurate expectations

A common failure mode I've seen and experienced in relationships is the "other person doesn't hang out with me enough" failure mode.  In my experience, the absolute amount of time spent together matters less than the difference between reality and your expectations.  Talk about how much time you want to spend together per week, and if you have a week when you're expecting to be too busy to spend your usual time with a significant other, tell them a week or two in advance.  

In a similar vein, to be accommodating to a busy significant other, I've learned to interpret a lot of maybes as nos.  I'm surprised at how easily I trick myself into thinking that things that might happen will almost certainly not happen, and then being pleasantly surprised when they sometimes do happen.

## In any relationship

### Your partner is the person it is easiest for you to hurt
Since so much emotion tends to ride on relationships, it's easy to hurt your partner.  If a friend flakes on an appointment I'll probably shrug it off, but if a significant other does it usually stings.

### Check in every once in a while (but don't expect every problem to be resolved)
Create times set aside to talk about how things are going.  This can be a time to raise problems and try to think of ways to solve them.  This can also be a time to think of ways your relationship can get more awesome, even if there's no immediate problem.  Don't expect every problem to be solved right away, or ever, though.  

### Talk about your partner to other people
I remember one summer I had a boyfriend who had an internship in another state.  I would have liked to hear from him in some form every day, which I told him repeatedly, and which he repeatedly appologized for not doing.  I was pretty annoyed at him for this until I talked to another friend, who said "you know, communication every day is probably a lot of communication for him."  Hearing that completely broke me out of my funk and I was able to relax and enjoy his emails and calls the few times a week that they came.  In general, talking with people about my problems helps me feel better about them and come to better outcomes.  When my problems involve my partner, I need someone besides my partner to talk to them about.

### Express affection
Receiving affection makes your partner happy and comfortable with you.  "I love you"s, random hugs, small presents and meaningful complements are all easy things to do that have an outsized emotional impact.

## Breaking Up

### Take your time
This is a process.  Don't jump to the conclusion that it's time to end it the moment you start feeling doubts about a relationship.  Sit on it.  Sometimes they go away.  Obviously, sometimes they don't, but there's no hurry.  

You should also give your partner plenty of time to think about what's going on.  Hopefully you've been raising issues as you go along, but bring up the things that make you unsure about the relationship before you're last conversation as a couple.

### Learn to recognize what breaking up feels like
It's easy to break up and have an awful set of breakup emotions, and interpret them as your psyche telling you you've made a huge mistake.  Learn to interpret these as your psyche telling you you just broke up.  Breakups are hard.

### Keep your distance for a little while
I find that right after breaking up, a lot of people strongly prefer not to see their former partners.  This usually wears off, and people go back to being friends, but realize that this might take a while, and keep your distance until then.
