title: Cooperation isn't Surprising
---

Scott Alexander recently [explained why](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/) you should argue politely with your enemies (this was in response to some comments on [this post](http://www.jefftk.com/p/are-feminist-blog-stats-atypically-bad) advocating much the opposite).  Arguing politely with your enemies instead of using nasty tactics is a good idea and, and Scott's explanation is correct.  However, he seemed to think that the fact that we pull this off is a bit more surprising than I do.

> But consider the following: I am a pro-choice atheist. When I lived in Ireland, one of my friends was a pro-life Christian. I thought she was responsible for the unnecessary suffering of millions of women. She thought I was responsible for killing millions of babies. And yet she invited me over to her house for dinner without poisoning the food. And I ate it, and thanked her, and sent her a nice card, without smashing all her china.

> Please try not to be insufficiently surprised by this. Every time a Republican and a Democrat break bread together with good will, it is a miracle. It is an equilibrium as beneficial as civilization or liberalism, which developed in the total absence of any central enforcing authority.

The fact that Democrats and Republicans break bread together may be a sign that something very surprising has happened, but I don't think that it in itself is very surprising.

My lack of surprise doesn't come from my model of people as rationa actors selfishly trying to acheive their ends; it comes from my complementary model of people as squishy bags of chemicals.

In particular, my experience as a bag of squishy chemicals is that I really like other people.  Not universally, but overwhelmingly, and the better I know any individual, the more I like them.

This is true regardless of ideology.  Like Scott, I am a pro-choice atheist.  I am also friends with pro-life Christians.  In fact, several.  One of the same ten or so people whose faces are featured on the bulletin board above my desk is banned from my facebook wall because I want to see his face but not his opinions.

To armchair theorize a little bit:

I don't think squishy-chemical-bags understand words like "pro-choice" or "Catholicism."  These words refer to big concepts fairly removed from the concrete, day-to-day things that squishy chemical bags are mostly concerned with.

On the other hand, squishy-chemical-bags care a lot about other people.  We're social animals, our survival historically depended on us liking each-other enough to work together.  In fact, it still does.  So it makes sense, not only that we care about other people, but that that we like them.

We all have squishy-chemical-people inside of us, and when as far as our squishy-chemical people are concerned, cooperation with people we encounter often is generally advantageous.  This is not to say that those reasoning, outcome optimizing people don't exist, but they're only half the story.

It may be a miracle that we live in an ideologically mixed society.  However, once Democrats and Republicans are living down the hall from one-another, working together, and bumping shoulders on the train and at sporting events, each individual friendship between ideologically opposed people is hardly remarkable at all.  In our direct interpersonal interactions at least, civility and tolerance provide a stable equilibrium-- once we've acheived it, it tends to perpetuate itself.
