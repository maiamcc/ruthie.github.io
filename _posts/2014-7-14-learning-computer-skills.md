title:  On What They Can't Teach You in Intro Programming Courses
---

There's a type of obstacle a lot of people face where they're learning computer programming.  Someone tells them to do something like to "compile their code" or "install something" and they know what this means but they don't how to do it.

Here's an example:

Computer code written in computer languages like c and go needs to be translated into binary code before it can be run.  This is done by a program called a compiler.  It's a simple system, but it's much easier to understand what it does than to use it.  If I have some c code, and I want to run it, what do I do?

## Why I care

This is only one of many similar problems.  How do you install things?  How do you run a webserver?  How do you set up a hostname for your computer?  Configure an operating system?  These don't sound like exciting problems, but they're frequently the barriers to doing cool stuff with computer science, like writing programs and running websites.  The knowledge needed to solve these problems--operating systems, networking, sysadmin skills--are not beginner skills, but beginners need to use them.

When I was in high school learning to program, I remember being discouraged and sometimes paused for months on a problem like this.  I don't think my experience is unique.  I had an acquaintance in college who said that in high school, she learned HTML and made a home page for herself with links to things she liked to visit, but she never figured out how to put it on the internet.  She just kept it as a file on her desktop and opened it in her browser.  More broadly, this type of problem is frequently cited as particularly discouraging by my friends.  I don't want to see people discouraged from pursuing computer science because of problems like this.

## How I learned to use a compiler and how I approach it now

I learned to do things like compiling programs and running web servers by experiment and example.  If I needed to compile something, I'd look up how to on the internet, try it, try to parse the error, look up how to fix that, try again.  As I used  a tool, I'd start to notice patterns and cobble together an understanding of it.

I've gotten better at a lot of things since my beginner days:

1. I've seen more examples of how programs usually work

2. I know a lot more about what's going on in a computer

3. I have more practice at translating from concepts to actions

The first thing means I have better guesses as to how to use a compiler.  The second lets me debug better when my guesses are wrong.  The third helps me use documentation and internet searches to figure out how to use a thing.  

A little bit of this is now systematic knowledge.  I didn't learn it systematically, but I have organized it in my head in useful ways that are theoretically transferable to other people.  For example, I can list ways to give input to a program, and ways that programs give output.

## How can I teach this kind of knowledge to others?

It would be difficult to teach these skills to beginners.  First of all, they're not easy skills.  Time programming and time using a command line made operating system concepts seem a lot less abstract.  Second, these skills aren't usually interesting to beginners, and when students aren't interested in learning something, they generally don't.  Most importantly, though, these aren't the most important skills that beginners can be learning.  Compared to basic programming, the operating system, network, and system skills are more work to learn and less widely applicable than basic programming skills.

My best idea of how to bring students over this barrier is in person support.  If I am physically present in a classroom of students, I can help them through the frustrating problems that might otherwise stop them without them needing to go through everything they'd need to generate the solutions themselves.  This isn't a very satisfying answer though-- it's not easily scalable, and it's only available to those who manage to make it into classrooms or aren't too shy to ask for help.

I'm curious about how other people made it over these bumps.  My impression is that most of us who made it through a CS program spent hours stuck trying to install something.  What got you unstuck?  What prevented you from being stuck?
