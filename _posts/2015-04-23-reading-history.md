title: Why I have Suddenly Grown an Interest in History
---

I have been really enjoying reading books about history recently.  I got [Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition](http://smile.amazon.com/Last-Call-Rise-Fall-Prohibition/dp/074327704X) because I was interested in how social movements work, and I thought I might gain some insight by learning about one I didn't know much about yet.  I enjoyed that book a lot, mostly for reasons unrelated to my original motivation for buying it, so the next time I was in a book store I browsed the history section and picked up [Marriage and the Family in the Middle Ages](http://smile.amazon.com/Marriage-Family-Middle-Ages-Frances/dp/0060914688).

These books did not try to draw deep or universal conclusions, but had more of a "here are some things that happened, and this is what it was like" tone.  The extracurricular history books I've read in the past (like Guns Germs and Steel and A People's History of the United States) were definitely trying to make points beyond the specific events they described, and while I enjoyed them and got things out of them, I found it exhausting to read them and overwhelming to try to evaluate their claims.  On the other hand, books that just give surveys of particular parts of the past don't force me to take a side in a great debate, but do teach me things I didn't know before and give me new and interesting perspectives on the present.

These books have filled a couple of important niches in my life.

One is bedtime reading.  These books were not intellectually challenging enough to require me to be fully awake to appreciate them, and they were interesting enough to make me want to read them without being so riveting that I couldn't put them down.

The other is conversation starters.  There are people who I spend enough time with that I have a hard time findig topics we are both interested in that we haven't hashed over already.  It's easy to start a conversation about history without the other person having to do any background reading (compare to, say, physics, or even fiction reading).  It's also easy to connect history to the present day, which means that conversations that start on history often end up on other interesting and relevant-to-our-lives topics that we might not otherwise think to talk about.
