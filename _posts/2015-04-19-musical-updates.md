It's been a while since I've written about making music here.  I've done a lot of it, and improved a lot, so I wanted to talk about the things that I've been doing and what's changed.

### Asking really good fiddlers for lessons

I don't have anything approaching weekly lessons, but I have had several one-off lessons.  Over the last year or so I've had about half a dozen music lessons with four different people.  These have been incredibly helpful in terms of giving me things to practice and ultimately in changing the way I play.

A lot of the most helpful things boiled down to very simple suggestions:

* Emphasize the upbeat more
* Play with less bow
* Leave more space between the notes

These are all ideas I'd encountered before, mostly be observing other fiddlers, but hadn't implemented very well yet, which makes me think that maybe I should have been able to access these improvements without lessons.  I'm not convinced though-- I notice a lot of things about how other fiddlers play, and it can be hard to tell which are important and which aren't.  And frankly, even if I need to pay $45 and go through the inconvenience of arranging a lesson in order to make this type of thing sink in, it's still well worth the cost to me.

### New bow

I bought a bow!  I was inspired by playing around with a friend's carbon fiber bow to see if I wanted to get one myself.  The new bow is a bit unusual in that it's extremely light.  It took some getting used to, but now that I'm used to playing with it, I like it a lot.  It's much easier to control anything that involves lifting the bow off of the string and putting it back.  That means I have an easier time with chops, or just putting more space between the notes, which, oh hey look, was a thing I was trying to work on!

One thing the process of trying new bows made me realize is how much I like my old bow.  That bow was a 14th birthday present, which means that I was playing with it for almost exactly ten years (wow!).  I had to spend a lot of time during the bow-trying process asking myself whether I liked that bow because I was used to it or because it was a good bow.  I'm pretty convinced it was just a good bow.  After all, I found something I liked better, but only after trying 10s of bows, all of which cost more than my old one.

### Moar band members

In March, Ben and I were invited to play as a last-minute-substitute band at a local dance.  For fun, we asked our friend Will to join us on guitar and mandolin, and we had such a good time that we asked him to also join us for all of our future gigs.  

Having a third musician allows us to do lots of things we couldn't do before.  I can play chords or a harmony while Will keeps the melody going on mandolin, and Ben can play accordion while Will backs us up on guitar.  In general, I was a lot more cautious experimenting in a duo setting, because if I messed up we would lose the melody and the dancers might get lost.  Playing with three feels a lot more like a jam session, which is more fun for us, and more fun for the dancers.

Overall, the Stolen Goods is doing well.  At first we were asking other people to book us, but now other people sometimes ask if we'll play their dance!  It's certainly not a complete transition, but it's an encouraging step.
