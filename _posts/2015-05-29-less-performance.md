title:  Less Performance, More Musicmaking
---

There's this conversation I have pretty regularly.  I'm chatting with someone and I mention that I play fiddle.  They perk up and say, "oh, cool.  I have a violin at home, but I haven't played it since high school.  I've thought about playing fiddle music, but never really got started."

This strikes me as a huge failure of our music education system.  I talk to violinists, but I'm sure that the vast majority of high school band and orchestra members also have an instrument in a closet somewhere that they haven't touched in years.  Thousands of students a year graduate from high school music programs, but only a few go on to play in community choirs, bands, or orchestras.

I find making music incredibly rewarding and I find it most rewarding in recreational sit-in-my-livingroom-and-hang-out situations, rather than performance situations.  However, school music emphasize musical formats (orchestras, marching bands, big choirs) that are well suited for performance over ones that are well suited to recreation.

Furthermore, I don't think that you can have your cake and eat it too.  Enough of the goals of performance are just completely orthogonal to the goals of fun that emphasizing performance will inevitably mean sacrificing fun.  Performing entails choosing formats and styles of music that people want to hear-- in the case of most school music programs, orchestras, where the conductor does the creative work and the musicians just follow instructions.  In order to perform well, you need to polish particular pieces of music, which basically means playing them over and over exactly the same way, even if you're bored of them.  Rehearsing also requires lots of time and dedication, often from a lot of people, which is easy when the time is literally taken out of the school day, but hard in the real world.

Recreational living-room music can be done by any number of people at any time.  You don't need a consistent, dedicated group, or a conductor to have a good time.  You can play exactly the music you feel like, learning new tunes as the old repertoire gets stale, and you can improvise and experiment without worrying that you'll sound bad.

There's an imagineable music education system where students spend most of their times in small ensembles, playing music they choose.  This could be classical string quartets, but it could also be bluegrass, or jazz, or pop-- students will be most motivated by music that they genuinely want to play.  You could have a showcase performance at the end of the year, or you could just not.  I think you'd be much more successful at creating lifelong habits of musicmaking this way.
