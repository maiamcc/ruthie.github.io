## Engineering the Internet

Engineering the Internet was a 40 hour course I taught in Summer 2013 for MIT ESP's [Junction](http://esp.mit.edu/learn/Junction) program, an academic program for high school students organized by MIT students. It introduced computer science by having students write and deploy a static website and understand the underlying infrastructure.

You can still visit the [class website](http://engineeringtheinternet.nfshost.com) and read my [comments on what I learned](http://engineeringtheinternet.nfshost.com/explanation.html).
